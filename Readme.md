# Introduction

This is a very simple C++ project built using complex logic to offer a reusable and flexible message box.

# How it is different ?
Core idea is to make a function to create message box dynamically just as it happens in visual basic. 
The box should have title, borders, should be in center of screen and parameters should be simpler to use.


# Example of message box
```
msgbox(" Manage Items ! ",
           "1. Add Item \n2. Modify Item\n3. Remove "
           "Item\n4. Search Item \n5. Item by Code\n6. "
           "Back");
```

Would produce result as

 ![Manage Item](/screenshots/Picture3.png)


# More about project

It is a simple inventory management system, which allows user to add item, check stock, generate receipts etc. A very basic project as my 12th standard computer science project.
